# Todo List

### Purpose 
This is my approach to the Todo List project as assigned by The Odin Project.


### Features
- Simple but effective CRUD structure
- Create, edit, and delete custom projects and todos
- Unique attributes for each todo including priority
- Modern and clean UI
- Use of localStorage to save and load user data upon refresh or browser close

### Reflection
As the first CRUD project that I've created to date, I've started to notice more and more of the importance of code organization and cleanliness.  Having good code as well as having code easily readable code is incredibly important as the projects become larger scale.  Also working collaboratively, splitting the code into unique sections is useful.
